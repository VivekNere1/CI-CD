The basic workflow to move one ec2 instance from one region to another region we have 
to create snapshot of the region1 instance and create an AMI image of that instance in 
that region and copy that AMI image in that region2 where we want to move that 
instance and from that copy image, we can again launch that instance in region2.
1)Go to the instance of Mumbai and select that instance.
2)Go to the storage of that instance and click on the volume ID
3)select that volume then go to the action and select create snapshot option
4)Then Go to the Elastic Block storage then click on Snapshots then select that 
snapshot and give name to that snapshot.
5)Now we need to create an AMI image of that instance from that snapshot so select 
that snapshot then click on ‘action’then click on ‘create image from snapshot’
6)Give name and description to that image and create that image
7)Now click on ‘images’then click on ‘AMI’to see whether image get created or not
8)Now we want to copy that AMI in Singapore region so, click on that AMI then click on 
action then click on Copy AMI and then we need to select a region where we want to 
copy that AMI.
9)Now switch to the Singapore region and go to the AMI select that AMI and rename it 
then click on Launch instance from AMI then give name to that instance give key-pair 
and security group and launch that instance.
