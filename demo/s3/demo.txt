#To mount s3 bucket with ec2 instance we required 4 things.
1. Aws ec2 instance for mounting s3 bucket.
2. S3fs and AWS CLI package for mounting and configuring environment.
3. Unique s3 bucket with globally access.
4. Create Aws IAM programmatic user with s3 full access permission.
Step 1:
Step2:
Connect the instance
sudo su â€“
1 yum update all
yum install automake fuse fuse-devel gcc-c++ git libcurl-devel libxml2-devel make 
openssl-devel
git clone https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse.git

cd s3fs-fuse
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-openssl
make
sudo make install
which s3fs
step3:
create bucket
uncheck Block all public access
check acknowledge
create bucket
step4:
search IAM
click on user -> add user->give user name->select aws credential type: access key:
programmatic access -> next permission-> attach excisting policies directly -> 
search s3fullaccess->next->next->create (at last we get access key and secret key)
1. IAM -> 2. Users -> 3. Vivek -> 4. Create access key
Now we want to mount s3 bucket with ec2 instace permanently:
mkdir /test ->mount point
touch /etc/passwd-s3fs
chmod 600 /etc/passwd-s3fs
vim /etc/passwd-s3fs (access key:secret key )
vim /etc/fuse.conf (uncommet user_allow_other)
for permanent mount we have to update fstab fie
vim /etc/fstab (s3fs#myfirstbucket30112001 /test fuse _netdev,allow_other 0 0)
 Bucketname /mountfolder 
To check mount:
mount -a
df -Th /test/
cd /test/
ll
now we can see files from our s3 bucket.
cp Provisional\ University\ degree.pdf /root/ (to copy the file to root)
cd
ll
we can see file copied in root.
Cd /test/
Touch Vivek.txt{1..10}
You can see in aws s3 interface file created from terminal.
